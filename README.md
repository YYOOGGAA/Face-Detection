# Face-Detection
Face Detection Project

-**description**-

It's the project that can detect easy single front face.
Some pictures with multiple faces that any two faces aren't too close to each other can be successfully detected.
Cats and Dogs can be correctly detected as not-face input, but piggy doll with pink skin can't be successfully detected.


-**How to Run**-

Need to run skin.m first to use the svm model to get the skin region.
FaceDect.m is the main m file. All the main steps of finding a face are there.
